# Placebo Security

## Sales pitch

Placebo Security plugin gives you peace of mind as a site owner. Lots of other security plugins slow down your site and introduce security vulnerabilities on their own but not this one. You won't notice any performance hit and this plugin cannot include any security vulnerabilities at all.

## What it does?

Literally nothing.

Placebo Security doesn't actually break anything but it's still good idea not to install this.

## What's the issue?

WordPress plugin doesn't actually have to, you know, do anything. The thing is that you cannot really tell what a plugin is doing from just the UI. Casual user can and should read the description, reviews and a few support issues to get an idea of what a plugin is doing.

To actually understand what the plugin does or doesn't do requires technical knowledge and some level of source code auditing. This can be very time consuming, hard to do and overwhelming task so mostly plugins are used by their reputation and through experiences. We mostly trust that plugins do what we think they do.

This can be an issue when we don't take proper action because we trust that for example 3rd party security plugin takes care of the security.
