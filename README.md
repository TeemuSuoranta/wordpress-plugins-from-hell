# WordPress Plugins from Hell

This is a jokingly created collection of WordPress plugins that will absolutely WRECK your site. Don't install these. Seriously.

WordPress plugins have great power to affect almost every aspect of WordPress either by legitimate ways, by malice or by incompetence. This extendability is really the key of why WordPress is so flexible but it is important to understand the gravity of this situation and your responsibility as a plugin developer. These are not secret vulnerabilities or software design flaws.

Click through these plugins and get to know many ways plugins can affect your site. The plugins included are functional and installable but please don't.

The goal of this repository is to give you a little hesitation before clicking that activate plugin button on unknown plugins before looking into them.
